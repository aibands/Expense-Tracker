# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What went well
- We have finished all the design parts, including the Home, Add, Transaction, Categories, Settings, and Notification pages. We also completed the HTML and CSS structures for the Home, Add, Transaction, and Categories pages, which shows great progress and a fast pace.
  
## What could be improved
- We haven’t finished building the Settings and Notification pages as planned since each page took longer to complete than expected. We also included too much work in one sprint compared to our actual capacity. I think we shouldn’t overload each sprint so we can make sure everything is completed as planned.

## Action item(s) for next sprint
- We will finish building all the page structures and start implementing some functions on each page.
