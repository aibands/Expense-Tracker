# Sprint 2 Retrospective — Expense Tracker

---

## What Went Well

- All page structures are now complete
- Core logic for adding income and expenses is functional
- Categories are dynamically rendered and budget values are displayed
- Team collaboration and task ownership improved from Sprint 1

---

## What Could Be Improved

- Graph logic was more complex than expected and wasn’t finished
- Some UI elements still lack responsiveness on smaller screens
- Need to test more thoroughly across browsers and devices

---

## Action Items for Next Sprint

- Finalize graph logic and connect it to stored data
- Add edit/delete functionality for transactions
- Improve responsiveness and test on mobile
- Begin implementing profile settings and preferences
