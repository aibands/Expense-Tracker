## Project Overview 
A web application that allows users to track their expenses and income by adding, editing, deleting, and categorizing transactions.
All data is saved using LocalStorage, so it remains available even after refreshing or closing the browser.
Developed across three one-week sprints using the Scrum framework.

All interface designs were created by our team.
